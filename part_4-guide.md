## Part 4: Adding Observability with Docker Compose

Now that I had my multi-container setup running with Apache and NGINX, I wanted to add **observability** ‚Äî basically, a way to see what's going on under the hood.

To keep it clean, I created a single compose file that handles everything ‚Äî both the original services **and** the monitoring tools. I called it:

```bash
docker-compose.metrics.yaml
```

Then I launched the whole stack with:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.metrics.yaml up -d
```

This spun up all my web servers **plus** monitoring tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and some exporters.

---

### What This Compose File Does (Plain English)

Here‚Äôs how I understand it:

- I included my `web1`, `web2`, and `web3` services ‚Äî same Apache image, but now with an extra config file: `status.conf`. That enables Apache‚Äôs `/server-status` endpoint so Prometheus can pull metrics from them.

- My `nginx` service is still reverse-proxying the 3 Apache servers, like before.

- I added **nginx-exporter**, which talks to NGINX and exposes its internal metrics on port `9113`.

- I added **Prometheus**, which scrapes metrics from all exporters. It uses a config file I made called `prometheus.yaml`.

- I added **Grafana**, which gives me dashboards to visualize the data. It runs on port `3000`, and I set the default admin password to `admin`.

- I also added **node-exporter**, which exposes system-level metrics from the host machine ‚Äî things like CPU, memory, and disk usage.

All the services are connected through a shared virtual network:

```yaml
networks:
  monitoring_network:
    driver: bridge
```

That way, they can talk to each other by name ‚Äî like `web1`, `prometheus`, `grafana`, etc.

---

### Folder Structure

Here‚Äôs how my project folder looks now:

```bash
my-compose-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.metrics.yaml     # All services (web + monitoring)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prometheus.yaml                 # Prometheus scrape config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nginx.conf                      # Load balancer config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index1.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index2.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index3.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ status.conf                     # Apache status module config
```

## Phase 4: Adding Observability with Docker Compose

Now that I had my multi-container setup running with Apache and NGINX, I wanted to add **observability** ‚Äî basically, a way to see what's going on under the hood.

To keep it clean, I created a single compose file that handles everything ‚Äî both the original services **and** the monitoring tools. I called it:

'''
docker-compose.metrics.yaml
'''

Then I launched the whole stack with:

'''bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.metrics.yaml up -d
'''

This spun up all my web servers **plus** monitoring tools like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and some exporters.

`docker-compose.metrics.yaml` 

```yaml

### Folder Structumre

Here‚Äôs an example project direcotry structure:

```
docker-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.metrics.yaml     # All services (web + monitoring)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prometheus.yaml                 # Prometheus scrape config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nginx.conf                      # Load balancer config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index1.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index2.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index3.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ status.conf                     # Apache status module config
```

---












## New Monitoring-related additions: prometheus.yaml and status.conf

Here‚Äôs what I have inside my Prometheus scrape config file, `prometheus.yaml`:

```.conf
global:
  scrape_interval: 5s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']

  - job_name: 'nginx-exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['nginx-exporter:9113']

  - job_name: 'nginx-direct'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['nginx:80']
        labels:
          group: "nginx"

  - job_name: 'httpd-services'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['web1:80', 'web2:80', 'web3:80']

  - job_name: 'node-exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['node-exporter:9100']
```

---

And here‚Äôs my Apache `status.conf` that I mount inside each Apache container:

```
# Load the status module
LoadModule status_module modules/mod_status.so

# Enable extended status (IMPORTANT for detailed metrics)
ExtendedStatus On

# Enable server status page
<Location "/server-status">
    SetHandler server-status
    # Allow access from anywhere (for Docker containers)
    Require all granted
</Location>

# Optional: Also enable server info (useful for debugging)
<Location "/server-info">
    SetHandler server-info
    Require all granted
</Location>
```

---

### What these new addtions do:

- In `prometheus.yaml`, tells Prometheus how often to scrape metrics (`5s`), and where to find them:

  - Prometheus scrapes itself on `localhost:9090`.

  - It scrapes NGINX metrics via the `nginx-exporter` on port `9113`.

  - It scrapes NGINX directly on port `80` for basic stats.

  - It scrapes each Apache server (`web1`, `web2`, `web3`) on port `80`.

  - It scrapes the system metrics from `node-exporter` on port `9100`.

- In `status.conf`, it enables Apache‚Äôs `mod_status` module and its extended status features so Prometheus can gather detailed metrics about Apache‚Äôs performance.

- The `/server-status` endpoint becomes available inside each Apache container and is accessible by Prometheus because it allows access from anywhere.

---

## Useful Ingress/Monitoring Tools:


**nginx-exporter** *(Docker image)*  
Pulls NGINX metrics (requests, connections) so Prometheus can scrape them.  
‚Üí Available from Docker Hub: `nginx/nginx-prometheus-exporter`

**status.conf** *(Custom config)*  
Enables Apache‚Äôs `/server-status` page for exposing live metrics.  
‚Üí You create this file manually and mount it into your Apache containers.

**Scraping** *(Prometheus feature)*  
The process where Prometheus fetches metrics from targets at regular intervals.

**Prometheus** *(Docker image)*  
Time-series database that scrapes and stores metrics.  
‚Üí Available from Docker Hub: `prom/prometheus`

**Grafana** *(Docker image)*  
Dashboard tool for visualizing Prometheus data.  
‚Üí Available from Docker Hub: `grafana/grafana`

**prometheus.yaml** *(Custom config)*  
Configuration file listing scrape targets and settings.  
‚Üí You can write this file yourself to control how Prometheus behaves.



## Usability


### 5. Accessing Observability Tools

After running the observability stack using:

`docker compose -f docker-compose.metrics.yaml up -d`

![alt text](assets/images/compose_up.png)

All services came online. Here's how to access and verify each one:

---

#### üîç Prometheus

- **URL:** `http://localhost:9090`
- Opens the Prometheus dashboard.
- To check service health:
  - Navigate to `Status ‚Üí Targets`
  - Each service like `web1`, `nginx`, `node-exporter` should show `UP`

![alt text](assets/images/targetsprom.png)

---

#### üìä Grafana

- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **First login credentials:**
  - `admin` / `admin`
- You'll be prompted to change the password immediately.

![alt text](assets/images/custompassword.png)


To connect Grafana to Prometheus:

1. Go to `Configuration ‚Üí Data Sources`
2. Click `Add data source`
3. Choose `Prometheus`
4. In the URL field, enter: `http://prometheus:9090`
5. Click `Save & Test` to confirm connectivity

![alt text](assets/images/add_data_source.png)



---

#### üìà Dashboards

With Prometheus connected, you can:

- Build your own dashboards using PromQL
- Or import popular pre-made dashboards

Example:

- Dashboard ID: 12708 is what I chose: (nginx-exporter)

![alt text](assets/images/add_dashboard.png)

![alt text](nginx_dashboard.png)

After loading, you should see a green "UP" status bar!

To import:

1. Click the `+` icon in Grafana
2. Select `Import`
3. Paste the dashboard ID (12708)
4. Select the Prometheus data source
5. Click `Import`

---

![alt text](assets/images/grafana_graph.png)

---
#### üåê NGINX Web Access

- **URL:** `http://localhost`
- NGINX reverse proxies traffic to:
  - `web1`
  - `web2`
  - `web3`
- Refreshing the page shows different versions if each index file is unique

---

#### üìâ NGINX Exporter

- **URL:** `http://localhost:9113/metrics`
- This endpoint exposes raw NGINX metrics
- Scraped by Prometheus for connection stats and request rates

![alt text](nginx_metrics.png)

---

#### üíª Node Exporter

- **URL:** `http://localhost:9100/metrics`
- Exposes system-level metrics (CPU, RAM, disk, etc.)
- Scraped by Prometheus to monitor the host environment

---

At this stage, observability is fully operational. You can now:

- View service and system metrics live in Grafana
- Query Prometheus directly for deeper insights
- Monitor the health of your stack from a central location

### Simulate traffic

By using a curl command you can simulate server traffic to your nginx ingreass and observer the grafana dashboard response:
