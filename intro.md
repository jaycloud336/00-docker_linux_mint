# Docker On Linux Mint!

 This project was a self-directed challenge to deploy a containerized application using Docker on Linux Mint—a desktop-focused distribution not typically used in enterprise environments. While Linux is the most natural and widely supported operating system for Docker, distributions like CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and Ubuntu Server are more commonly used in production environments. Working within a home lab setup on Mint gave me a chance to explore Docker's flexibility and behavior outside of traditional enterprise systems.

The goal was to replicate core Docker workflows—building and running containers, managing images, and configuring basic container networking—while also introducing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) concepts such as isolated networks and load balancing. This hands-on project served both as a practical learning experience and as a way to deepen my understanding of containerization and infrastructure fundamentals across varied environments.
